#W03_h03_API

My intention with this piece was to allow the user to make  comic strips based on a string of words that they've chosen. For each input box, there should be a .gif that can be retrieved from the internet using the Giphy API that corresponds to the words, however, it's just not doing that at the moment. The idea is just that the panels would pair visuals to words as a way of translating the story into something visual and abstract.


##Update
I've got the API linked up now, but for some reason, no matter what word I type in it gives me the same pilot .gif. Also, I couldn't quite figure out how to set each .gif to each search box. I think that will have to be soemthing I look deeper into and figure out with for loops.
