For the first sketch, when you press the button, the LED's will light conseculatively one after the other with minor delays in between. Once you let go of the button, the LED's will dissipate after one another with a delay.

In the second sketch, when you first turn on the light without the Arduino, LED's 2 and 4 will light up automatially. Once you press the button, it will switch to LED's 1 and 3. When you release the button, it will revert back to its original state.
