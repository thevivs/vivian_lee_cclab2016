# PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH

## About

In this assignment, I was trying to have two characters on the screen in which one is the bully and the other is the victim. Ideally, I would've wanted to have the face change depending on how many times the mouse is pressed and he would look more and more beat up the more times he's punched. But, I am still having trouble with arrays and for loops and couldn't figure out how to implement that in my code. 

Also, I started to write this code using the P5 app and when I tried to transfer it over to Sublime, the code wouldn't load when I tried this. I was trying to fix it so that the code words would sit on top of the image and not floating over it. Furthermore, if I had been able figure out how to do that, I would've then set a command for the sentence "you just beat the sh*t out of a stranger! do you feel good about your?" to appear after the victim is punched, and not appear as soon as the page is loaded.
