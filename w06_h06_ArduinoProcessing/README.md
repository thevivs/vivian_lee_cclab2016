The code is stating that if the Arduino input is high, then fill random. However, sometimes there would be no fill (which means low input, technically) but the circles are big. So, if they are big how can there not be current flowing through? Isn't the Potentionmeter suppose to regulate how big much of the current goes through? Or is it because I turned the potentionmeter all the way to the highest and that's where it stays and after awhile, the current stops flowing through it? Is the potentionmeter in this case just controlling the size of the circle?
